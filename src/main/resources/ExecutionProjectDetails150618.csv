A512,Restart and Lookback C3 for Mobile and Dotcom,"This project will leverage real-time-encoding (RTE) to 1) allow customers to restart rights-permitting programs on Live Streaming channels when tuning into the program after it has already started, and 2) make rights-permitting programs available as VOD content after the program has aired for the duration of the C3 window. “Restart” is the branded name of the Live Streaming “Start Over” service. “Look Back” is an internal name only for the C3 VOD service, formally referred to as “72 Hour Look Back”. This service will not be branded for customers, and Look Back titles will appear as VOD titles with no special “Look Back” or “C3” visual distinction.
